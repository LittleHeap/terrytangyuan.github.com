    <p> I am currently working as a data scientist at <a href="http://uptake.com" style="color:green;">Uptake</a> in Chicago, IL. 
        I focus on building predictive models and streamlined modeling engine used across multiple verticals. 
        I also work in conjunction with software engineering team to build scalable and distributed data science engine for model deployment. </p>

    <p>Before joining Uptake, I was a full-time data scientist at <a href="http://gastrograph.com" style="color:green;">Analytical Flavor Systems</a> 
        and my focus was on predictive condition monitoring and flaw detection on artisan beverages such as coffee and beer using sensory science 
        and machine learning. </p>

    <p>I graduated from the Pennsylvania State University in Mathematics with honors. Since my senior year at Penn State, I've been a founding member of <a href="http://datanovo.com" style="color:green;">DataNovo</a>, 
        a legal analytics company that provides predictive insights, keywordless prior art search, and product assessment on infringement 
        for law firms, patent attorneys, etc. </p>
    
    <p>During my free time, I am quite active in open-source community. Please check out my <a href="http://terrytangyuan.github.io/projects/" style="color:green";>project page</a> and <a href="http://terrytangyuan.github.io/about/" style="color:green";>Github page</a> for more information.
