    <p> I am currently working as a data scientist at <a href="http://uptake.com" style="color:green;">Uptake</a> in Chicago, IL. 
        I've been working on a wide variety of projects here at Uptake, focusing on building scalable data science platform, including streamlined predictive modeling engine, model lifecycle management system, and operational monitoring system for production applications, used across multiple verticals. I work closely with data scientists, software engineers, site operation engineers, as well as infrastructure engineers. </p>

    <p>Apart from my work at Uptake, I am an active contributor to numerous open-source softwares, including TensorFlow, XGBoost, MXNet, etc. Please check out my <a href="http://terrytangyuan.github.io/projects/" style="color:green";>projects page</a> and <a href="http://terrytangyuan.github.io/about/" style="color:green";>Github page</a> for more information.
        I also work part-time at <a href="http://rstudio.com" style="color:green;">RStudio</a> as a software engineer, dedicating to open-source community in the field of machine learning.
    </p>

    <p>Before joining Uptake, I was a full-time data scientist at <a href="http://gastrograph.com" style="color:green;">Analytical Flavor Systems</a> 
        and my focus was on predictive condition monitoring and flaw detection on artisan beverages such as coffee and beer using sensory science 
        and machine learning. </p>

    <p>I graduated from the <a href="http://psu.edu" style="color:green;">Pennsylvania State University</a> in Mathematics with honors. Since my senior year at Penn State, I've been a founding member of <a href="http://datanovo.com" style="color:green;">DataNovo</a>, 
        a legal analytics company that provides predictive insights, keywordless prior art search, and product assessment on infringement 
        for law firms, patent attorneys, etc. </p>
